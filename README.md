Unfortunately, could not add an other ethernet to CHR mikrotik router, but the CHR hotspot and PPPoE setting have been done.

FREERADIUS Successfully installed on ubuntu, but unfortunately could not run Ansible-playbook
youtube helped a lot
For a section titled Ubiquiti Hotspot Configuration, I have already arranged Ubiquiti Unifi Network Server v8 on my laptop.
